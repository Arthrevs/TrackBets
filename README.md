🛠️ The Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js + Vite, featuring a high-fidelity "Neon-Dark" UI for a premium trading desk experience.

Backend: FastAPI (Python) hosted on Render, architected for high-performance asynchronous processing.

AI Engine: OpenAI GPT-4 Integration, optimized for financial reasoning and sentiment synthesis (Pivoted from initial Gemini architecture for enhanced demo stability).

Data Strategy: A hybrid approach using simulated real-time data feeds and mock datasets to demonstrate full-cycle analysis without API latency during the pitch.

✨ Key Features
Dynamic Analysis: Processes tickers (e.g., ZOMATO.NS, TSLA) through a multi-step financial brain.

Strategy Wizard: User-centric workflow to define entry targets and investment timeframes (Quick Scalp vs. Long-Term).

Sentiment Synthesis: Mimics the aggregation of news and social media trends to provide a "Market Pulse" percentage.

Actionable Verdicts: Delivers a final Buy/Sell recommendation backed by an AI-generated explanation of the logic.

🗺️ Future Roadmap
Live API Integration: Transition from mock data to production-grade market feeds (Polygon.io / Zerodha Kite).

Portfolio Tracking: Real-time P&L tracking via brokerage API connections.

Advanced ML Models: Implementing custom-trained models for technical indicator prediction.
